## Hi, I'm Yusuf ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior or master or whatever you call it front-end developer.

Born & raised in Turkey / Ankara, I'm genuinely inspired by creators of my workspace like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Over eight years in business, I have had a chance to work on a variety of projects, with agencies, companies or even individuals. Custom work is my territory, perfection in details is my obsession and harmony in code is my passion.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on React and React Native
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Strapi and Next.js
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about CSS animations, user experience and react
